Showcasing My Android Development Journey - UX, UI, API Integration & More
📖 About This Project
This project is my first Android app, built to explore:
✅ UI/UX Principles – Handling user navigation, interactions, and smooth screen transitions.
✅ Firebase Authentication – User login, registration, and session management.
✅ Jitsi API for Video Calling – Seamlessly integrating video calls with astrologers.
✅ Android Internals – Using SharedPreferences, deep linking, and background services.
✅ WhatsApp & Call Integration – Users can directly message astrologers or call them from the app.
✅ CRUD Operations – Booking & canceling poojas, handling dynamic responses.
✅ Static Chat Functionality – Responds based on keywords like love, career, etc. (Future scope: AI-based chatbot).

🎯 Main Motivation: Understanding how Android apps are structured, from UI/UX to API integrations and backend authentication.
